        <br>
        <p>Hello my name is Mitchell O'Rourke and I am a student at NEiT.  I love to skateboard and the outdoors, these two normally mix well besides for the winter.  I live with my parents and grandmother and we have two dogs.  I grew up in the woods and that's were I feel most at piece not having any sort of outside source or presence entering my space.  Senior year of high school I built a quarter pipe for my senior project and the final result was 4' tall and width was about 7.5' long.  If it wasn't for my love of techology I propably would have been a carpenter.  I'd love to mix these passions of mine in the future between skateboards and computers.</p>
